Here is the page where the modal partial lives. 

This modal's purpose will be to verify that the user actually
intends on deleting a class with all related data. 

The user will be required to type in the name of the class 
they wish to delete. 

If, and only if, the name of the class matches the class 'delete'
button which was clicked will that class actually be deleted.
